Repository for the study by [Puliti et al. (2025)](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.14503) to benchmark tree species classification using proximally sensed laser scanning data (TLS, MLS, ULS). This work is part of the COST action 3DForEcoTech [3DForEcoTech](https://3dforecotech.eu/) and co-funded by [SmartForest](https://smartforest.no/). To cite this work use:

# What is the study case about
The overall aim consists of developing a **benchmark dataset** for **developing** new point cloud tree species classification models and **benchmarking** them

# Available data sources (approx. 20K trees ü§Ø)
## Datasets
The FOR-species20K data can be downloaded from the [Zenodo repository](https://zenodo.org/records/13255198)

Below you can find some metadata regarding the available datasets.

| dataset_name  | n_trees | n_species | data_type | Sensor | acquisition | annotation_quality | forest_type | x | y |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| wieser_TLS  | 264 | 12 | TLS | RIEGL VZ-400 | 15 scans per ha | manual | temperate | 14.7073 | 48.6638 |
| ...  | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Trees 
Tree metadata can be found in the tree_metadata_training_publish.csv. Each row represents a single tree with the following fields:

| treeID  | species | genus | dataset | data_type | tree_H | filename |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| 1  | Picea_abies | Picea | wieser_TLS | TLS | 15.5 | /train/00070.las |
| ...  | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | 

the "tree_H" variable is simply the difference between the top and bottom z value for each tree and should be used only to get a rough understanding of tree size, however keep in mind that this does NOT necessarily correspond to the real tree height.

### Tree distribution by tree species (33 tree species with more than 50 trees)

# Data science competition (Nov 2022 - May 2023) üèéÔ∏è 
The data science competition will run from Jan 2023 to Apr/May 2023. Each contributor will be able to make a maximum of 3 submissions.

To make a submission should send me (stefano.puliti@nibio.no) a csv file with predictions on the test dataset and with the following two columns:
| treeID  | predicted_species | 
| ------------- | ------------- | 
| 523  | Pinus_sylvestris |
